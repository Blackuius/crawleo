<b>SOFTWARE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT</b>

In this project, I plan a robot that will automatically interact every day on all the sites of our company and will take prints and after completion, it will send, besides a warning, all the photos via telegram so that we can analyze all the sites no matter where we are.

Initially, I was planning a method to check if the sites were working correctly, but the methods I found so far did not present a faithful return of the current state of the site since they only returned information from the server.
So we weren't sure that the site even looked good on the air had a nice look.
So coming up with this bot would open up all the sites and take impressions, save them in a mass and send an email notification.

However, in the middle of the process, I identified that via telegram the warning would be more efficient.

In the current state of the project, the bot is already opening the sites, taking out prints, and notifying us via telegram but now the next step will be to send images of the sites via telegram for remote verification of the sites.

* finished project base in 06/05/2021
